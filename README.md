# SEO Visibility and Performance Analysis of Nigerian Banks

## Overview
This project analyzes the *SEO visibility and keyword performance* of major Nigerian banks within the consumer banking space.  
It demonstrates my ability to *collect raw data, clean and transform it using Python, and communicate insights through interactive Power BI dashboards*.

The analysis answers key business questions such as:
- Which banks dominate search engine visibility?
- How widely do banks rank across consumer banking keywords?
- Does SEO visibility show any relationship with bank revenue?

---

## Business Objective
To evaluate how Nigerian consumer banks perform in *search engine visibility* and determine whether strong SEO presence correlates with *financial performance*.

This analysis is positioned from a *marketing and business intelligence perspective*, focusing on visibility dominance rather than keyword counts alone.

---

## Data Source & Structure
The dataset was self-generated using *WordStream Free Keyword Tool*.

### Original Columns
Each bank’s keyword dataset initially contained:
- Keyword Text  
- Competition  
- Competition Index  
- Search Volume  
- Low Top of Page Bid  
- High Top of Page Bid  

### Final Analytical Dataset
After cleaning and transformation, the dataset used for analysis contained:
- Bank  
- Keyword  
- Search Volume  
- Competition  
- SEO Visibility Score  
- Bank Revenue  

Unnecessary bid-related and index columns were removed to maintain analytical focus.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Researched consumer banking keywords for *10 Nigerian banks*.
- Downloaded keyword datasets for each bank individually.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Merged all datasets into a single table using Python.
- Standardized keyword and bank name formats.
- Removed irrelevant columns and handled inconsistencies.

### SEO Visibility Metric
To quantify online dominance, an *SEO Visibility Score* was created using:

> *SEO Visibility Score = Total Keywords per Bank × Total Search Volume per Bank*

This metric reflects both keyword breadth and search demand.

### Revenue Analysis
Publicly available bank revenue figures were added to examine correlation with SEO visibility.
